### About
My solution to the Reddit coding challenge: [Challenge337](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/78twyd/20171026_challenge_337_intermediate_scrambled/) 

### Overview
The basic challenge is that you are presented with a scrambled image. You then need to write code to descramble the image and decode the embedded image.
The image has ‘_color markers_’ that you need to align. Once aligned, the image will be descrambled.

This is a good excercise that tests a few coding skills for solving a given problems.

### Usage
The application has a c# Form GUI.
There are three active buttons (_the forth is not active_).

[**Open**] : Opens the provided scrambled image
[**Descramble**]: Runs the algorithm to descramble the provided images (except the bonus)
[**Descramble2**]: Runs the enhanced algorithm to descramble the `bonus` image.

### Todo
- Activate and implement the 'Save' feature.
